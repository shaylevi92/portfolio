                <h1>Hey there!</h1>
                <p class="lead">I'm Shay, a fresh-faced UX/UI enthusiast on a mission to sprinkle a little magic into the digital world.</p>
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Based in sunny Tel Aviv, I'm all about blending creativity with practicality to craft memorable user experiences. Last year, I proudly graduated with honors from HIT College, where I pursued my bachelor's degree in learning technologies.</p>
                    <p>During my studies, I discovered the fascinating intersection between learning methodologies and user experience design. I believe that the ease with which users interact with a digital interface significantly impacts their overall satisfaction and productivity. As a designer, my goal is to create human-centered designs that are intuitive, adaptive, and easy to learn.</p>
                    <p>I'm deeply interested in understanding human behavior, cognition, and emotions to craft interfaces that resonate with users on a personal level. Beyond design, I'm also fascinated by animation, interface design, and psychology.</p>
                    <p>In my free time, you can find me exploring new hiking trails, experimenting with new cooking recipes, or diving into a good book. I'm always seeking opportunities to learn and grow both personally and professionally.</p>
