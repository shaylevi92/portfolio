            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>My Agriculture Story</h3>
            <p>As a son of a farming family, the world of agriculture was always an inseparable part of my life. In my childhood, I worked in the family greenhouses together with my grandfather and father during summer vacations. The hard work and manual inspections of the plants were a daily routine, but they made me wonder how to improve the operation of the greenhouses and make it more efficient.</p>
            
            <h3>Precision agriculture, a revolution in the world of agriculture</h3>
            <p>With the advancement of technology, I understood that it is possible to create a technological solution that will assist farmers in managing greenhouses in a more advanced and automated way. This is how the idea for developing a smart greenhouse management system was born.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="project-problem">
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <h3>Expensive operations and manual labor play for profit</h3>
            <p>Farmers work tirelessly every day to maintain optimal growing conditions in greenhouses in order to ensure fast and high-quality growth. They are constantly on the lookout for problems in plants to quickly treat sick plants and prevent loss of money. When it comes to large areas, their work becomes very strenuous and physically demanding.</p>

            <h3>Existing systems are complicated and unfriendly</h3>
            <p>Many outdated and inconvenient systems do not take advantage of current technologies to create simpler and more convenient interfaces for farmers. Remote control is limited to immediate on and off or fixed schedule, and does not save manual work. As a result, farmers remain busy with daily operations instead of focusing on increasing profitability.</p>

        <section class="project-solution">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <h3>AI-Based Agricultural Management System</h3>
            <p>iPlant is a platform that enables remote monitoring and control of growing conditions using artificial intelligence that learns the preferences of farmers and types of plants in their greenhouse. The system provides real-time alerts for plants that require care and creates personalized action scenarios, such as turning on and off ventilation systems, spraying, watering, and turning on lighting. The solution improves resource management efficiency, reduces manual labor, and saves on water, electricity, and working hours.</p>

                    <h3>Discover</h3>
                    <h4>Competitors analysis</h4>
                    <p>I analyzed 3 leading platforms with advanced technological solutions. I found that while some competitors use basic AI models, users still need to perform manual tasks to manage devices. Many systems focus on a single area, like irrigation (Netafim's GrowSphereâ„¢) or growth analysis (CropX), but lack comprehensive control over all farm devices, leaving farmers with manual work.</p>
