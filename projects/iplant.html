                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <h4>Expensive operations and manual labor play for profit</h4>
                    <p>Farmers work tirelessly every day to maintain optimal growing conditions in greenhouses in order to ensure fast and high-quality growth. They are constantly on the lookout for problems in plants to quickly treat sick plants and prevent loss of money. When it comes to large areas, their work becomes very strenuous and physically demanding.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Existing systems are complicated and unfriendly</h4>
                    <p>Many outdated and inconvenient systems do not take advantage of current technologies to create simpler and more convenient interfaces for farmers. Remote control is limited to immediate on and off or fixed schedule, and does not save manual work. As a result, farmers remain busy with daily operations instead of focusing on increasing profitability.</p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <h4>AI-Based Agricultural Management System</h4>
                    <h5>Customized automations in a simple and intuitive interface</h5>
                    <p>iPlant is a platform that enables remote monitoring and control of growing conditions using artificial intelligence that learns the preferences of farmers and types of plants in their greenhouse. The system provides real-time alerts for plants that require care and creates personalized action scenarios, such as turning on and off ventilation systems, spraying, watering, and turning on lighting. The solution improves resource management efficiency, reduces manual labor, and saves on water, electricity, and working hours.</p>

                            <h5>There are solutions, but control is still partial</h5>
                            <p>I analyzed 3 leading platforms with advanced technological solutions. I found that while some competitors use basic AI models, users still need to perform manual tasks to manage devices. Many systems focus on a single area, like irrigation (Netafim's GrowSphereâ„¢) or growth analysis (CropX), but lack comprehensive control over all farm devices, leaving farmers with manual work. This led me to develop a solution with AI automation, allowing personalized adjustments and maximum remote control of greenhouses, increasing efficiency and simplifying daily farming tasks.</p>
